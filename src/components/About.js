      <h2>About Me:</h2>
      <p>I have been studying code on my own since 2018. In this time, I've mostly been working on personal projects and repositories. Though it's been a bit frustrating at times, the most satisfying feeling is solving a self induced problem or finding just the right documentation for a situation. Every week is full of learning new skills and testing old ones.</p>
